          <p>
            By designing a web scraper, I was able to gather information on over
            100k sold homes from the past 15 years in Quebec. I then used
            visualization tools to generate a series of graphs offering a unique
            insight into Quebec's housing market. Finally, I designed a neural
            network using Tensorflow. This allowed me to train a model capable
            of predicting a home's final selling price with a 15% margin of
            error.
