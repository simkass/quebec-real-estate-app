        <h1>Acquiring the Data.</h1>
        <p>
          In Quebec, the only website (I could find) that openly exposes data on
          sold houses is <a href="https://duproprio.com/en">DuProprio</a>. This
          website allows homeowners to sell their houses without the use of an
          agent. The data I was interested in was sold homes and condos,
          anywhere in Quebec. Luckily, DuProprio allows users to filter their
          search using these exact criteria.

          , I was able to build two Python scripts to scrape data from
          DuProprio. The first script goes through all the pages of listing
          thumbnails and acquires the listingsâ€™ individual links.
