            <p>In Quebec, the only website (I could find) that openly exposes data on sold houses is <a href="https://duproprio.com/en">DuProprio</a>. 
              This website allows homeowners to sell their houses without the use of an agent. 
              The data I was interested in was sold homes and condos, anywhere in Quebec. 
              Luckily, DuProprio allows users to filter their search using these exact criteria.</p>

              <p>Using <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup</a>, I was able to build two Python scripts to scrape past listings from DuProprio. 
                The first script goes through all the pages of listings previews and acquires the listingsâ€™ individual links. </p>
