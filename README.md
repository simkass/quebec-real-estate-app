By building a web scraper, I was able to gather information on
nearly 100k sold homes from the past 15 years in Quebec. I used
this data to generate a series of graphs exposing the most
important features for home valuation. Finally, I used Keras to
train a neural network that can predict a home's final selling
price with a 15% margin of error.
